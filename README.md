# Data Analysis and Replication Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis and replication project. The project involves three main tasks: translating and reproducing an econometric/statistical analysis, replicating findings from a research paper, and extending a meta-analysis study. Each task is explained in detail below.

## Task 1: Translating and Reproducing an Econometric/Statistical Analysis
### Description
- Translate existing code to a different programming language (e.g., R to Python).
- Reproduce the results of the original analysis using the translated code.
- Identify areas of improvement, update the data if necessary, and perform robustness checks.
- Discuss findings, potential issues, and conclusions.

### Code
The code for this task can be found in the [Task1](/Task1) directory.

## Task 2: Reproducing Findings from a Research Paper
### Description
- Select a peer-reviewed research paper with no attached code.
- Reproduce the main findings described in the paper.
- Report any challenges or issues encountered during replication.

### Code
The code for this task can be found in the [Task2](/Task2) directory.

## Task 3: Extending a Meta-Analysis Study
### Description
- Select a meta-analysis study to extend.
- Reproduce the original results using the reported sample of studies.
- Add 2-5 newer studies following the original selection process.
- Replicate the results with the extended sample.
- Describe and discuss the findings.

### Code
The code for this task can be found in the [Task3](/Task3) directory.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Follow the instructions in each task directory to run the code and reproduce the analyses.
- Refer to the specific README files within each task directory for detailed instructions.

## Dependencies
- List any dependencies or external libraries required for running the code in each task.

## Results
- Include a summary of the findings and conclusions for each task.
- Any visualizations or additional documents can be found in the respective task directories.
